# Capstone2
I have selected next word prediciton for my capstone project.
I will be using methods of natural language processing, language modeling, and deep learning. I will start by analyzing the data followed by the pre-processing of the data.
I will then tokenize this data and finally build the deep learning model. The deep learning model will be built using LSTMâ€™s. The entire code will be provided in this GitHub repository.
