# Capstone2
I have selected next word prediciton for my capstone project.
I will be using methods of natural language processing, language modeling, and deep learning. I will start by analyzing the data followed by the pre-processing of the data.
I will then tokenize this data and finally build the deep learning model. The deep learning model will be built using LSTMâ€™s. The entire code will be provided in this GitHub repository.

# dataset
The dataset is from an eBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur Conan Doyle.
The Datasets for text data are easy to find and we can consider Project Gutenberg which is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, to encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks.
